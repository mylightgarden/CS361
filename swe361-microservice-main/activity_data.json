Move slowly through each pose, remembering to breathe as you move. Pause after any pose you find challenging, especially if you are short of breath, and start again when your breathing returns to normal. The idea is to hold each pose for a few, slow breaths before moving on to the next one. Child's Pose : This calming pose is a good default pause position. You can use child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pose to rest and refocus before continuing to your next pose. It gently stretches your lower back, hips, thighs, knees and ankles and relaxes your spine, shoulders and neck. Sukhasana: This easy pose is good to relieve stress. Sit cross-legged on a yoga mat with your hands on your knees, palms up. Keep your spine as straight as you can. Push the bones you're sitting on down into the floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201d your \"sit bones\" in yoga-speak. Close your eyes and inhale. \"This is a great pose for beginners to use as an assessment,\" says Gwen Lawrence, yoga coach for the New York Knicks and other sports teams, athletes, and celebrities. \"Just sitting on the floor gives you a perfect way to see and feel the external rotation on the legs.\" This pose also boosts back flexibility and can help relieve stress.",
